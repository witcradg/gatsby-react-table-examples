# Gatsby pages demonstrating React Table
## a simple wrapper and minor tweaks
3/12/21

This project is almost entirely based on source code from react-table by Tanner Linsley <a>https://github.com/tannerlinsley</a>

His work is remarkable and includes several other interesting React projects that I'll be looking into. I would encourage you to support him. He's put in a lot of work into react-table and into the documentation and especially the examples available on CodeSandbox.

Useful Links for his work on react-table:

</ul>

## Motivation
I created this project as a study tool and as a playground for various react-table implementations using Gatsby. I wanted a place to tinker outside active client projects. 

I found a small problem with namor that I was able to fix by replacing it with faker. (Webpack was reporting an issue with crypto.)

I'm also expecting to be able to copy pages and reuse them in future projects.

### Additional notes
This project was created with Gatsby's default starter although a number of packages were removed. I added TailwindCSS although I don't use it in the example code (so far).

If you find it useful I'd love to hear about it.
If you create a table I haven't implemented yet I'd love to add it here.
